# C++ Programs using Classes and Objects

This repository contains several basic **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** examples in C++. Each program demonstrates the concept of **classes, objects, data members, and member functions**.  

---

## Theory

In C++, **classes** are user-defined data types that act as a blueprint for creating objects. A **class** can contain:
- **Data members** (variables that store data)
- **Member functions** (functions that operate on data)

An **object** is an instance of a class. Using objects, we can access and manipulate the data defined inside the class.

Key OOP concepts demonstrated in these programs:
- **Encapsulation**: Binding data and functions together.
- **Data abstraction**: Hiding implementation details and exposing only necessary functionality.
- **Code reusability**: Defining once and using multiple times (e.g., creating multiple objects from one class).

## Algorithms  

### 1. Car Details
1. Define a class `Car_Details` with attributes: name, brand, purchase year, model number, and cost.  
2. Create an object `s1`.  
3. Take input from the user for car details.  
4. Display all stored values.  

---

### 2. Cube Volume
1. Define a class `cube` with attributes: height, width, and length.  
2. Create a member function `volume()` to calculate `height * width * length`.  
3. Create object `cube1`.  
4. Call `volume()` and display the result.

### 3. Rectangle Area
1. Define a class `Rectangle` with attributes: length and width.  
2. Create a member function `area()` to calculate `length * width`.  
3. Accept input values for length and width.  
4. Display the area.  

---

### 4. Calculator
1. Define a class `Calculator` with two numbers.  
2. Implement functions: `add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()`, and `divide()`.  
3. Ask the user to enter two numbers.  
4. Display a menu for operations.  
5. Use a switch case to perform the selected operation.

### 5. Student Details
1. Define a class `student` with attributes: name, branch, subject, and result.  
2. Create two objects `s1` and `s2`.  
3. Assign values directly.  
4. Display student details.  

---

### 6. Rectangle Area (Inside and Outside Function)
1. Define a class `Rectangle` with attributes: length and breadth.  
2. Define two functions:
   - `area()` → function defined **inside the class**.  
   - `insideArea()` → function defined **outside the class**.  
3. Create object `R1`.  
4. Call both functions to calculate area.  

---

## Conclusion

- These programs show how **classes and objects** form the backbone of **OOP in C++**.  
- Functions can be defined both **inside** and **outside** the class.  
- Using objects, we can store and process **different sets of data** without rewriting the code.  
- OOP makes programs **modular, reusable, and easier to maintain**.  
- Practical applications include modeling **real-world entities** like cars, students, calculators, and geometric shapes.
